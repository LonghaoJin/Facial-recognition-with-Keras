# Facial Expression Recognition with Keras
The project comes from Coursera's guided project: [Facial Expression Recognition with Keras](https://www.coursera.org/programs/86ebe3a1-8523-43c0-a9da-7374390c1e9a/browse?entityTypeDescription=Rhyme+Projects&index=prod_enterprise_products&productId=IC9GxmJ7EeqZhwpHN8ICRw&productType=course&query=computer+vision+&showMiniModal=true).

In this project, we are going to build a CNN in Keras. There are 7 different categories of facial expression: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise and neutral. And we are going to achieve the following goals:
1. Develop a facial expression recognition model in Keras.
2. Build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN).
3. Deploy the trained model to a web interface with Flask.
4. Apply the model to real-time video streams and image data.

# User Instructions
1. Download and unzip the data from **images.rar**.
2. Run the notebook **Facial_Expression_Training.ipynb**, and then **model.json** and **model_weights.h5** will be created.
3. Change the file name in **camera.py**.
4. Run file **main.py** to customize your own experiment!
